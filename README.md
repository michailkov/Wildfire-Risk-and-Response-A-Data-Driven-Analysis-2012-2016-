# **Wildfire Risk and Response: A Data-Driven Analysis (2012‚Äì2016)**  

## **Overview**  
This project presents an analytical study of **wildfire incidents in Greece** from **2012 to 2016**, focusing on **environmental factors, fire behavior, and emergency response effectiveness**. Using **SAS for data processing and visualization**, the study explores **how temperature, wind speed, and resource allocation impact wildfire severity**. The findings aim to support **data-driven decision-making** for wildfire risk management and emergency response planning.  

## **Objectives**  
- **Identify** key environmental factors influencing wildfire duration and spread.  
- **Analyze** seasonal and geographical patterns of wildfire outbreaks.  
- **Assess** the impact of temperature and wind speed on fire expansion.  
- **Evaluate** the effectiveness of firefighting resources and personnel allocation.  
- **Provide** recommendations for civil protection authorities on risk mitigation.  

## **Methodology**  
The analysis was conducted using **SAS**, following these steps:  
1. **Data Collection**: Wildfire incidents, meteorological data, and emergency response records.  
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and structuring datasets in SAS for consistency.  
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying trends and correlations between fire severity and weather conditions.  
4. **Visualization**: Creating charts and dashboards to illustrate key findings.  
5. **Interpretation**: Drawing insights to improve wildfire response strategies.  

## **Key Findings**  
### üî• **Factors Influencing Wildfire Duration**  
- Higher **wind speeds** and **temperatures** contribute to prolonged fire duration.  
- Rainfall has **minimal effect**, highlighting the importance of wind and temperature monitoring.  

### üå≤ **Factors Affecting Burned Area Size**  
- Large-scale wildfires occur more frequently when **wind speeds exceed 15 km/h** and temperatures surpass **20¬∞C**.  
- Wind direction plays a critical role in determining fire spread patterns.  

### üö® **Wildfire Risk Alerts**  
- Civil protection authorities should issue **high-risk alerts** when:  
  - **Average temperatures exceed 20¬∞C**.  
  - **Wind speeds rise above 15 km/h**.  
- These thresholds serve as key indicators for **early warning systems**.  

### üèî **Geographical & Seasonal Trends**  
- The **third quarter (July‚ÄìSeptember)** experiences the highest wildfire activity.  
- **Northern Greece and the Islands** have the most extensive burned areas.  
- Wildfire incidents significantly decline in the **first and fourth quarters** due to cooler weather.  

### üöí **Resource Utilization & Personnel Deployment**  
- **Firetrucks** are the most frequently deployed resource, peaking in the third quarter.  
- **Aerial firefighting (helicopters, planes)** is critical but used selectively due to costs.  
- The **Peloponnese and Attica** require the highest number of firefighting personnel.  

## **Technology Used**  
- **SAS** for statistical analysis and visualization  
- **Geospatial mapping** for wildfire distribution analysis  
 
## **Why No Code is Provided?**  
This analysis was conducted exclusively using **SAS**, which does not involve open-source scripts that can be shared in this repository. However, the **report and findings** are documented to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research.  

## **Application & Insights**  
- **Policymakers** can use the findings to improve **wildfire risk management**.  
- **Emergency response teams** can optimize **resource allocation** during peak fire seasons.  
- **Researchers** can build on these insights for further **climate and environmental studies**.
